# Trust Docker private network for cloudflared proxy
# Explanation:
# - Requests from Cloudflare arrive via the cloudflared container.
# - Inside Docker, containers communicate over the Docker bridge network.
# - 172.16.0.0/12 covers all private Docker subnets.
# - This ensures Home Assistant correctly sees the original client IP
#   and avoids rejecting proxied requests.
